Not like other applications in eXo Collaboration which have most common actions done via the context menu, the Chat bar allows you to do common actions directly, such as creating chat rooms, adding new friends, changing status. This bar is also the dock for all the minimized chat windows. You will see the notification about new chat messages in this bar when the related chat windows are minimized. This will be very convenient when you have to keep the conversation with many colleagues or in different chat rooms.

h2. From Space {anchor:id="CSUser_guide.Get_started.Access_applications_from_space"}
eXo Collaboration is an extended service of eXo Platform, so when being deployed into eXo Platform, you can access eXo Collaboration applications from the side navigation of a Space.
