h2. What is Knowledge? {anchor:id=KSuser.Overview.WhateXoKnowledge}
Knowledge is one of eXo Platform applications. This is a suite of applications, which contains everything you need for the knowledge management. Knowledge is made up of three main portlets: Forum, Answers and Wiki where you can share information, seek supports through helpful answers and post your ideas.

*Answers and FAQ*

*Answers* is a collaborative Question & Answer system similar to Yahoo! Answers or StackOverflow.com but for your own enterprise, where the collaboration is encouraged. With this application, you and your collaborators can post a series of common questions and find answers on a specific topic. Here, you can edit questions, provide answers and edit them. FAQ takes this content as input and publish it in a clean and quickly browsable manner. You can point a FAQ portlet to one or several Answers categories. As a publishing portlet, it is impossible to edit questions and answers in FAQ.

*Forum*

*Forum* is designed for the group discussion and user-generated content in which participants with common interests can exchange their opinions on a subject. While Answers is an ideal site for you to find answers quickly, Forum gives deep discussion through your posted topics.

*Wiki*

Wiki is an enterprise wiki application focused on content productivity for portal users as a tool to forge the unstructured knowledge. Wiki allows you to create and edit pages by using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG editor. With this application, your company can use Wiki as an internal reference, such as work policy, or a public wiki for a comprehensive product information. Wiki along with other Knowledge applications, such as Answers and Forum will complete the ideal combination that helps users enhance their experiences on collaboration activities and build valuable knowledge center for clients.

h1. Get started with Knowledge {anchor:id=KSuser.Overview.GetStartedWitheXoKnowledge}
h2. User roles {anchor:id=KSuser.Overview.User_roles}
In Knowledge, user groups may have different privileges to perform actions. Some actions can be limited to some specific user groups.
Knowledge uses a concept of User group, which is designed to give the advanced users the ability to control and assign what functions or features that other users can and cannot do within the application. There are four user groups: administrator, moderator, regular user and guest.

*Administrator* is an advanced user, who typically has the highest right when using Knowledge. The Administrator can manage user privileges and he has rights to perform all possible capabilities. For example, in Forum, an administrator can create categories, close/delete, lock/unlock forums; promote a regular user to moderator or create a category that is restricted to a specific user group.

*Moderator* obtains a subset of administrator's rights that means he has certain allowed capabilities and may perform these advanced actions in a specific area only. For example, a moderator in of a category in Forum can only perform advanced actions in the category that he is assigned as the moderator. The moderator role is assigned by the administrator. 

*Regular user* is defined as a logged-in user who can only use the basic features of Knowledge. The regular user can be promoted to the advanced user by the administrator.

*Guest (anonymous user)* is an unregistered/unlogged-in user who is often limited to a very few features only of Knowledge. For instance, a guest can view topics in Forum but he cannot reply or create new topics.

{Note}
Notice that there will be no section dedicated to this user role. For the actions that an anonymous user can perform, you can refer to the table that summarizes all the actions in each applications.
