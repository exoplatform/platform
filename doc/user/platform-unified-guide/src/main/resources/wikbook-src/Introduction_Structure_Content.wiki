Content is a main part of a website that may consist of various elements, such as texts, images, sounds, videos, animations, and more. In eXo Platform, you can manage both structured and unstructured content.

To create and manage the content more effectively and dynamically, you need to pay attention to the structure of each content, including:

* *Main content* contains all key content, such as texts, images, links, tables, and more.
* *Illustration* is an image which is used to clarify or explain the content. Also, a summary also can be added to this image.
* *default.css* contains CSS data which are used to present the web content, such as layout, font, color, and more.
* *default.js* contains JS data which are used to make web content more animating and dynamic.
