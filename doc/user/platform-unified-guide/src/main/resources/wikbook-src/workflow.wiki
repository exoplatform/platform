Two portlets, including <emphasis role="bold">Workflow Controller</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Workflow Administration</emphasis>, are deprecated in eXo Platform.

*Workflow* is the movement of documents and/or tasks through a work process. More specifically, workflow is the operational aspect of a work procedure: how tasks are structured, who performs them, what their relative order is, how they are synchronized, how information flows to support the tasks and how tasks are being tracked. As the dimension of time is considered in Workflow, Workflow considers "throughput" as a distinct measure. Workflow problems can be modeled and analyzed using graph-based formalisms like Petri nets.

eXo Platform supports two default processes that are used to request tasks from users:

* *Holiday process*: This process is used to request a task related to your holiday. If you want to have a holiday in a time interval, you should use this process.

* *Pay raise process*: This process is used when you want to propose raising your pay.
