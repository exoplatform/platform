          in accordance with Section 2.2.&nbsp; Any added Licenses will be subject to the
          following:&nbsp; (i) added Licenses will be coterminous with the pre-existing Term
          (either the initial Term or the renewal Term); (ii) the Subscription fee for the added
          Licenses will be the then-current, generally applicable Subscription fee for such; and
          (iii) any Licenses added in the middle of a billing period will be prorated for that
          billing period.&nbsp; eXo reserves the right to modify its Subscription fees at any

          not to renew at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the current contract
          term.&nbsp; Upon any renewal, eXo&rsquo;s then-current terms and conditions for the
          Subscription Services and this Agreement will apply. The renewal charge will be equal
          to the then-current number of CPUs times eXo&rsquo;s then-current list price
          Subscription fee at the time of renewal.&nbsp; Fees for any other services will be
          charged on an as-quoted basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; All eXo supplied Software and Subscription
          Services will only be delivered to Customer electronically through the Internet. Unless
          otherwise specified on an Order Form, all invoices will be paid within thirty (30) days

          payments will accrue interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1&frac12;%) per
          month, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted under applicable law. If payment of any
          fee is overdue, eXo may also suspend provision of the Subscription Services until such

          mutually agreed upon non-disclosure agreement negotiated in good faith and entered into
          by the parties (including any third party agent eXo may use in connection with such
          audit); (c) the audit will be conducted during normal business hours; and (d) eXo shall
          use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the disruption of Customer&rsquo;s
          normal business activities in connection with any such audit.&nbsp; eXo, or persons
          designated by eXo, shall not have physical access to Customer&rsquo;s computing devices
          in connection with any such audit, without Customer&rsquo;s prior written
          consent.&nbsp; Customer shall promptly pay to eXo any underpayments revealed by any
          such audit.&nbsp; Any such audit will be performed at eXo&rsquo;s expense, provided,
          however, that Customer shall promptly reimburse eXo for the cost of such audit and any
          applicable fees if such audit reveals an underpayment by Customer of more than five
          percent (5%) of the license amounts payable by Customer to eXo for the period
