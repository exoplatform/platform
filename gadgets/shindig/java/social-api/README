Installing and running the server
============================================

Please see BUILD-JAVA in the base project directory for information.

Once running, this url http://localhost:<port>/social/data will accept POST requests
   to update or fetch data. In order to see this code in action follow the README in java/server.


For more information, see http://incubator.apache.org/projects/shindig.html



Explanation of the current setup of the OpenSocial server code
===========================================================================

From within java/social-api/src/main/java/org/apache/shindig/social/...

=== Directories:
  *.java - classes necessary for handling all json data requests made from
      javascript. These calls can be the OpenSocial spec defined ones
      (handled by the opensocial directory) or any custom calls that the
      javascript needs the server to handle (see the
      samplecontainer/StateFileDataHandler for an example)
  opensocial/* - provides the OpenSocialDataHandler and all dependent OpenSocial
      related classes
  samplecontainer/* - provides the SampleContainer implementation that Shindig
      uses by default. If you are creating your own container it is best to
      model your code after this directory. If you wish to extend OpenSocial
      with additional data requests in a spec compliant way, follow the
      StateFileDataHandler example.



=== Main servlet: GadgetDataServlet

This servlet handles all requests to the social/data url. These
requests are expected to post two items of information, "st" which should map to
a gadget token and "request" which should be stringified json.

The "request" json should be an array of objects which all have a "type" field.
This type field is used to select the right GadgetDataHandler implementation to
process the request object. The data handler will be passed all of the fields in
the request object.

Here is an example of a valid request:
[{type : "FETCH_PEOPLE", idSpec : "VIEWER"},
 {type : "CUSTOM_TYPE", param1 : "value1", param2 : "value2"}]

This is an example of an invalid request:
[{idSpec : "VIEWER"},
 {param1 : "value1", param2 : "value2"}]
The items do not have type values and so can't be processed.


The default setup of Shindig uses the code in social/samplecontainer to process
all of the requests that come in. This code has one custom handler,
StateFileDataHandler, and also uses the standard OpenSocialDataHandler.



=== OpenSocialDataHandler: The wire format

The OpenSocialDataHandler handles all json request objects with the following
types:
    FETCH_PEOPLE,
    FETCH_PERSON_APP_DATA, UPDATE_PERSON_APP_DATA,
    FETCH_ACTIVITIES, CREATE_ACTIVITY

json details:

-------- Note: This will eventually switch to the RESTful apis. More information below. --------

FETCH_PEOPLE
  incoming json:
   {type : "FETCH_PEOPLE",
    idSpec : <opensocial idSpec>,
    profileDetail : <list of profile fields>,
    sortOrder : <opensocial.DataRequest.SortOrder>,
    filter : <opensocial.DataRequest.FilterType>,
    first : <int>,
    max : <int>}
  json produced:
   {items: <array of objects compatible with JsonPerson>,
    offset: <int>,
    totalSize: <int>}

FETCH_PERSON_APP_DATA
  incoming json:
   {type : "FETCH_PERSON_APP_DATA",
    idSpec : <opensocial idSpec>,
    keys : <array of strings>}
  json produced:
   <an object with the format: Map<PersonId, Map<Key, Value>> - matches the
   OpenSocial spec exactly>

UPDATE_PERSON_APP_DATA
  incoming json:
   {type : "UPDATE_PERSON_APP_DATA",
    idSpec : <opensocial idSpec>,
    key : <string>,
    value : <string>}
  json produced:
   none

FETCH_ACTIVITIES
  incoming json:
   {type : "UPDATE_PERSON_APP_DATA",
    idSpec : <opensocial idSpec>}
  json produced:
   {<array of objects compatible with JsonActivity>}

CREATE_ACTIVITY
  incoming json:
   {type : "CREATE_ACTIVITY",
    idSpec : <opensocial idSpec>,
    activity : <json compatible with
        gadgets.json.stringify(opensocial.Activity)>}
  json produced:
   none


The default Shindig setup receives its requests from
features/opensocial-0.7/jsoncontainer. If you use this javascript class your
json format will always match the server exactly. This wire format is always
subject to change as it is solely for the purpose of communicating between the
Shindig javascript and the Shindig java classes. Shindig will always be
compatible with itself and will not commit to staying constant for outside
dependencies. Note: soon, all of this code will change to only support the
RESTful api wire format. Both the javascript and the java code will be updated
when that happens.

If you wish to use Shindig to support OpenSocial it is highly recommended that
you implement the Service interfaces. This will isolate you from json wire
format changes.

If you do not wish to use Shindig to support OpenSocial, you should probably be
looking at the OpenSocial RESTful apis instead of this README:
http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/docs/dataapis.html



=== OpenSocialDataHandler - The service interfaces

In order to determine where the data for each of these requests is fetched from
the samplecontainer code provides implementations of the three OpenSocial
services: ActivitiesService, DataService, and PeopleService in the
samplecontainer/Basic*Service files.

You should provide your own implementations of these files to fetch data from a
database or an existing service, or some other storage mechanism. You can hook in
your own implementations of these interfaces by providing your own Guice module
in the web.xml file.
